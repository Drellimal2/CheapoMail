Features

Adding a user
    To simplify things for this assignment users can only be added by an administrator, there is no
    feature for new users to self sign up. An administrator logs in and completes the new user
    form. Use regular expressions to ensure that passwords have at least one number and
    one letter, and one capital letter and are at least 8 digits long.

User login
    A user goes to the login page and logs in. The system keeps track of the user using PHP
    sessions. Once logged in they are presented with the home screen which shows them recent
    messages which they can read and allows them to compose new messages.

Home Screen
    The home screen allows a logged in user to see their 10 most recent messages and also to
    compose a new message

User logout
    There will be a logout button which a user may select in order to logout of the system

Compose and send a message
    The compose message screen includes a "subject", "recipients", and "body".
    Once a message is complete the logged in user can click the send button to make the
     message go to all recipients.

A Grade Threshold
    The following features MUST be in place in order to get an A:
    Receive and read a message
    Each recipient of the message is alerted on their home screen of new messages. Each
    message is shown based on the subject and sender. Messages that have not been read are
    bold. When a message is opened it is immediately "flagged" as being read and is no longer
    bold in the home screen.
    No Page Refreshes
    All new pages should load without browser refresh, in other words you will need to implement
    an AJAX based approach to loading new content into the browser.
